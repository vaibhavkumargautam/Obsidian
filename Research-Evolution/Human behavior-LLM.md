# Umbrella discipline that captures a few different types of context

1. Instructions - prompts, memories, a few shots, examples, tools description, etc.
    
2. Knowledge - facts, memories, etc.
    
3. Tools - feedback from the tools.
    



# Drew Breunig nicely outlined longer context failures:  
• Context Poisoning: When a hallucination makes it into the context  
• Context Distraction: When the context overwhelms the training  
• Context Confusion: When superfluous context influences the response  
• Context Clash: When parts of the context disagree

Context engineering is critical when building agents!
